## Introduction
Interactiveness Knowledge indicates whether human and object interact with each other or not. It can be learned across HOI datasets, regardless of HOI category settings. We exploit an Interactiveness Network to learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization of interactiveness, our **TIN: Transferable Interactiveness Network** is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. *TIN* outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection results by a great margin, verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

**Please note that we have reimplemented TIN (e.g. replacing the vanilla HOI classifier with iCAN and using cosine_decay lr), thus the result here is different and slight better than the one in [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08264).**

## [HAKE](http://hake-mvig.cn/home/)
You may also be interested in our new work **HAKE**[[website]](http://hake-mvig.cn/home/), HAKE is a new large-scale knowledge base and engine for human activity understanding. HAKE provides elaborate and abundant **body part state** labels for active human instances in a large scale of images and videos. With HAKE, we boost the HOI recognition performance on HICO and some other widely-used human activity benchmarks. Now we are still enlarging and enriching it, and looking forward to working with outstanding researchers around the world on its applications and further improvements. If you have any pieces of advice or interests, please feel free to contact [Yong-Lu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/) (yonglu_li@sjtu.edu.cn).

## Acknowledgement

Some of the codes are built upon iCAN: Instance-Centric Attention Network for Human-Object Interaction Detection [[website]](http://chengao.vision/iCAN/ ). Thanks them for their great work! The pose estimation results are obtained from [AlphaPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose) . **Alpha Pose** is an accurate multi-person pose estimator, which is the **first real-time** open-source system that achieves **70+ mAP (72.3 mAP)** on COCO dataset and **80+ mAP (82.1 mAP)** on MPII dataset. You may also use your own pose estimation results to train the interactiveness predictor, thus you could directly donwload the train and test pkl files from iCAN [[website]](http://chengao.vision/iCAN/) and insert your pose results.
